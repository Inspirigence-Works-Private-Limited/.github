## About this Repository

<p align = "justify">The <code>.github</code> is a special :star2: repository :page_with_curl: that acts as a <i>fallback</i> for all other repository under an user or an organization (:information_source:<a href = "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-dot-github-repository/">more information</a>). This repository is thus developed with all the necessary files, thus no special files are required at each individual repository.</p>
